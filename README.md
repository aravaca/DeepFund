## 1. Algorithm Logic

### ‚ë† Valuation Metrics

* **Indicators:** PBR, PER, DCF, etc.
* Considers relative undervaluation against industry averages
* Some metrics are normalized into rank scores for evaluation

### ‚ë° Financial Health Assessment

* **Indicators:** D/E, CR, ICR, ROE, ROA, EPS growth, dividend growth, operating margin, etc.
* Scoring criteria defined in the `buffett_score()` function
* Example:

  * D/E ‚â§ 0.5 ‚Üí +1 point
  * EPS < 0 ‚Üí deduction

### ‚ë¢ Momentum Scoring

* Points accumulated when technical conditions met:

  * 20-day MA > 60-day MA (medium-term uptrend)
  * 50-day MA > 200-day MA (long-term breakout)
  * 20-day/60-day returns ‚â• 10%
  * RSI rebound confirmation
  * MACD golden cross

### ‚ë£ AI-Powered Sentiment & Macroeconomic Summary

* Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash Google Search** to:

  * Summarize recent macroeconomic trends
  * Interpret news articles with sentiment scoring
  * Generate stock picks based on quantitative + narrative alignment

---

## 2. Scoring and Stock Selection

* **B-Score** = Valuation score + Financial health score
* Total score = B-Score + Momentum score
* Select top X stocks by total score to build the portfolio

---

## 3. DCF Intrinsic Value Calculation

* Uses past 5 years of Free Cash Flow (FCF) data
* Intrinsic value calculated via DCF model based on FCF growth and discount rate
* Assesses undervaluation compared to current market price

---

## 4. Portfolio Optimization

* Calculates portfolio weights based on top stocks under four optimization criteria:

| Criterion | Objective Function                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Sharpe    | Maximize annual return / volatility          |
| Sortino   | Maximize annual return / downside volatility |
| CVaR      | Minimize average loss in worst 5% scenarios  |
| Variance  | Minimize overall return variance             |

* Results saved in separate Excel sheets (e.g., `Weights_CVaR`, `Weights_Sharpe`, etc.)
